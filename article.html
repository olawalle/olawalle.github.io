                        The University of Tasmania Library physical collections are spread over 10 locations. The management
                        of these locations is distributed over different teams within the University. Emergency management
                        for the University is the responsibility of Commercial Services Development (CSD). Work, health and
                        safety, a large component of disaster prevention is managed by the Work Health and Safety Team
                        within the Human Resources Section of the Chief Operating Officer Division. The Disaster
                        Management Plan for Library Collections sits in this broader framework.
                        The day to day management of library spaces is overseen by Student Services Information Centre
                        (SSIC). Library Services are responsible for the monograph (books, DVDs, journals, etc) collections at
                        all locations and work with CSD and SSIC to ensure that disaster prevention and management is in
                        place. These collections sit in buildings, with nominated building wardens, and have their own
                        hierarchy of emergency response. There are a number of people who could be first on the scene when
                        a critical incident occurs. CSD is responsible for emergency management and coordinates crisis
                        management, through the Crisis Management and Recovery Team (CMRT) for the University. The
                        Universityâ€™s Audit and Risk Unit, within the Governance Section, is responsible for Business Continuity
                        Planning.
                        The Library Collections include Special & Rare Collections located on Level 5 Morris Miller Library,
                        which houses the Royal Society of Tasmania (TRST) Collection; and smaller rare collections at the Art,
                        Music and Law Libraries. Rare collections need particular attention and this has been included in the
                        schedule of preventative measures & preparedness actions (Appendix 1)
                        The principles of prevention, preparedness, response, recovery, as outlined in the ALIA
                        documentation (2010), are followed.
                        This plan is used:
                            <ul>
                                <li>as a mechanism to schedule and ensure prevention of and preparation for disaster and other
                            critical incidents.</li>
                                <li>to provide guidelines for immediate response to emergencies that threaten collections and
                            initial recovery steps for anyone who might be the first on scene at a critical incident affecting
                            Library collections
                            .</li>
                                <li>
                                 provide guidelines for recovery steps, to be used by Library Services staff, post critical incident
                            recovery time</li>
                            </ul>
                             This plan is owned by Library Services and updated annually by Senior Librarian (Collections) and the
                            Disaster Management Team (Library Collections) (DMT (LC)).

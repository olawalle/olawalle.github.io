            <h2><strong>ABOUT</strong></h2>
            <p>
                    Currently working at Booking.com in Amsterdam.

                    Most of my work revolves around rethinking digital experiences. My skillset includes; User Interface Design, Web Development, Prototyping, and User Research.
                    
                    A few years ago, I worked at a design agency where I had the privilege of building awesome products and working with top clients from around the world.
                    
                    I've also failed at launching a successful startup.
                    
                    I'm currently unavailable for work, but if you just want to chat, you can contact me.
